# Creating a flutter app to test Facebook sign in

Facebook sign in is very similar to Google sign in (Spike 06). The following steps are the same:
1: Creating the basic frame.
2: Creating keystore file

The difference is how to set it up in Facebook. For that, refer to this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kdQgfb2hiI&t=474s

Sample login file is just copied from https://facebook.meedu.app/docs/7.x.x/example

To run, there is an error asking to switch to 8.2.1 (this is also fixed the same way as in Spike 06)
